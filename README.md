# go-vector
go-vector provides an easy to use library for creating and modifying vectors in Golang.

A Vector is a struct type with associated methods and functions that either operate on existing Vector structs, return new Vector structs, or calculate properties of Vector structs.

```go
type Vector struct {
	X, Y, Z float64
}
```

Basic usage looks something like this:

```go
v1 := vector.New(4,5)    // Creates new Vector{4,5,0}
v2 := vector.Random2D()  // Creates new unit Vector with random orientation
v2.Mult(5)               // Multiplies v2's magnitude by 5
v1.Add(v2)               // Adds v2 to v1, modifying v1
fmt.Println(v1.X, v1.Y)  // Prints v1's X and Y values
fmt.Println(v2.Mag())    // Prints v2's magnitude
```


## Intro to Vectors

This is a basic diagram of a vector. In two dimensions, it has both a direction and a magnitude (Î¸, r), or an X and Y (x, y). Math can be done on them, such as adding two vectors, or calculating the angle between them, or changing the magnitude.

For a quick tutorial on vector math, [go read this](https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/math/calculus/multivariable_vectors/introduction). Most of the basic functions have already been covered by this library, so you can jump right into adding vectors together or calculating the dot product.

In this library, a Vector is represented by the X, Y, and Z (which is 0 for 2D vector math) values of a point. The heading and magnitude are calculated from those values. A vector could also be used to keep track of points since it simply defines a point and the associated functions and methods do all the necessary math to calculate the corresponding vector. The memory overhead for creating a Vector is low, since it is just a struct of 3 float64 types. 

From the diagram (assuming the vector is called "vec"):
```go
r := vec.Mag()
theta := vec.Heading()
x := vec.X
y := vec.Y
```

## Examples

A simple physics simulator that adds up the forces (in this case, just gravity) on an object and calculates its location, velocity, and acceleration
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	vector "github.com/325Gerbils/go-vector"
)

func main() {
	gravity := vector.New(0, -9.8) // force of gravity
	acc := vector.New(0, 0)        // acceleration
	vel := vector.New(0, 0)        // velocity
	loc := vector.New(0, 0)        // location
	for {
		acc.Add(gravity)          // Apply Gravity to acceleration
		vel.Add(acc)              // Add acceleration to velocity
		loc.Add(vel)              // Add velocity to location
		fmt.Println(loc.X, loc.Y) // Print the new location
		acc.Mult(0)               // Reset acceleration every frame
	}
}

```

## Documentation

Most documentation is built in to the code. Here is a list of the types and functions:

```

func Random2D() Vector

func Random3D() Vector

func FromAngle(angle interface{}) Vector

func (v *Vector) Add(v1 Vector)

func (v *Vector) Sub(v1 Vector)

func (v *Vector) Mult(s interface{})

func (v *Vector) Div(s interface{}) 

func Add(v1, v2 Vector) Vector

func Sub(v1, v2 Vector) Vector

func (v Vector) Mag() float64

func (v Vector) MagSq() float64

func (v Vector) Copy() Vector

func (v Vector) Get() Vector

func (v *Vector) Normalize()

func (v Vector) Dist(v1 Vector) float64

Todo. 

## Planned features

Return a zero vector
```go
vector.Zero() // Returns Vector{0,0,0}
```

Print vector values
```go
vector.Print()   // prints {x, y, z}
vector.Print2D() // prints {x, y}
```
